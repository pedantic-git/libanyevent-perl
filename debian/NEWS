libanyevent-perl (6.010-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES ]
  * AnyEvent::DNS resource records now include the TTL as fourth element - this
    affects ->resolve, ->request and ->dns_unpack indirectly. Convenience
    functions such as AnyEvent::DNS::{a,txt,mx,srv} are not affected, neither is
    AnyEvent::Socket.
  * backend authors now should not implement one_event or loop, but instead the
    AnyEvent::CondVar::_wait and _poll methods.
  * verbosity levels have been redefined, see AnyEvent (PERL_ANYEVENT_VERBOSE)
    and AnyEvent::Log for details.

  [ DEPRECATIONS ]
  * please change "use AnyEvent::Impl::Perl" to "use AnyEvent::Loop" and
    "AnyEvent::Impl::Perl::loop" to "AnyEvent::Loop::run" in your programs, for
    future compatibility.
